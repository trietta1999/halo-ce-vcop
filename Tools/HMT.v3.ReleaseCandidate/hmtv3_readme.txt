 개 HMT is fairly simple to use - just open a map and select a resource from 개
 개 the resource browser.  If it has a dedicated plugin or an XML plugin, it 개
 개 will load and you will be able to edit certain properties and/or extract 개
 개 resources depending on the type of tag.                                  개
 개                                                                          개
 개 Map Rebuilding: This feature requires a little basic knowledge to use    개
 개 effectively.  Follow these steps in order to rebuild a map.              개
 개                                                                          개
 개 1. Into it's own folder, batch extract the multiplayer map that you wish 개
 개    to modify.                                                            개
 개 2. Open the map that you which to extract resources from and choose      개
 개    "Extract Meta" after selecting the proper tag.  If you would like to  개
 개    automatically extract all dependencies as well, check the "Recursive" 개
 개    box.  Choose a folder to extract the files to.                        개
 개 3. Copy the extracted files/folders to the folder you extracted the      개
 개    multiplayer map to.  Overwrite any existing files.                    개
 개 4. Choose "Rebuild Map" from the menu, and choose the Original Map (this 개
 개    is the original multiplayer map that you batch extracted earlier)     개
 개    *Note that the original map MUST be in the same folder as the batch   개
 개    extracted files.                                                      개
 개 5. Choose "yes" when prompted if you want to auto fill in the other      개
 개    filenames.                                                            개
 개 6. Now add any new files you wnat to add to the rebuild to the list at   개
 개    the bottom.  For example, if you want to add the Sentinal Beam weapon 개
 개    you would choose the Sentinal Beam.proj.meta file from the proper     개
 개    folder.  Note, that you only have to add the parent tag - any         개
 개    dependencies will be added automatically during the build.            개
 개 7. Now, click Rebuild and wait for it to finish.  Once it has completed  개
 개    the rebuild, you will have a new map file in the folder named         개
 개    OriginalMapName.map.rebuild.map.                                      개
 개 8. Copy this file to your Halo\MAPS\ folder, rename it to replace the    개
 개    appropriate map, and enjoy ;)                                         개
 개                                                                          개
 개 [Notice about bugs in certain plugins]                                   개
 개 tjc recently decided to leave the Halo Modding scene.  He is the         개
 개 author of the XML and Model plugins for HMT, and he has left them in an  개
 개 unfinished state.  Because of this, you will undoubtedly notice bugs     개
 개 with these plugins.  I plan on fixing these problems eventually, but     개
 개 rather than hold off on the release, I've decided to address the issues  개
 개 in a future release. They are still very usable, but you may find some   개
 개 annoynaces.  Please don't come crying or talking trash about the fact    개
 개 that these plugins have problems!  They will be fixed - do you really    개
 개 wanna wait and have nothing until then? :)                               개

 개 [Defenderz] Defenderz left Halo hacking shortly after I joined it but if 개

 개 A good portion of the most important discoveries were made by Defenderz, 개

 개 [tjc] tjc had joined the HMT project recently to help provide more       개
 개 functionalilty.  Unfortunately, due to personal reasons, he has decided  개
 개 to leave the scene and will not be taking part in future HMT efforts.    개
 개 Thanks for your contributions tjc.. you will be missed by all of us...   개

 개 [Iron_Forge] Map rebuilding would have never seen the light of day       개
 개 without the massive amount of help Iron_Forge gave me in the form of     개
 개 debugging, testing, and hardcore reverse-engineering.  There were many   개
 개 times that I was completely stuck and was only able to progress because  개
 개 of his help. He's also one of the few people in the scene that I really  개
 개 consider a friend, and he has provided me hours of good conversation     개
 개 throughout this project and has helped me to stay motivated.  So thanks  개
 개 Forge! ;oP                                                               개

 개 [Grenadiac]  While gren hasn't actually contributed to HMT, his awesome  개
